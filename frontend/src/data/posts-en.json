    "title": "From the Sénang to Parisian Barges: The Art of Living on the Water in Paris",
    "excerpt": "Houseboats, floating restaurants, private cruises: the Seine is the birthplace of a unique art of living. Discover the culture of waterside life in Paris and the story of the Sénang.",
    "content": "<p>In Paris, the <strong>Seine</strong> is not just a river: it is a neighborhood in its own right. For decades, hundreds of <strong>péniches</strong> (traditional barges) have lined its quays, housing residences, restaurants, concert halls, and artists’ studios. This <strong>art of living on the water</strong> is an under-appreciated yet deeply rooted Parisian tradition. At the heart of this floating culture, the <strong>Sénang</strong> carries on the spirit of the great Dutch barges while offering a unique <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> experience.</p>\n<h2>Parisian barges: a century-old floating culture</h2>\n<p>The history of <strong>Parisian péniches</strong> begins in the early 20th century, when the first bargemen’s families settled permanently on their boats, converting old cargo barges into year-round homes. After World War II, the decline of river freight freed up many vessels that found a second life as floating residences.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, <strong>péniches</strong> attracted a bohemian, artistic crowd. Painters, musicians, and writers moved into these unconventional spaces, drawn by the ever-changing light on the river and the freedom of waterside life. The <strong>Quai de la Tournelle</strong>, the <strong>Quai de Jemmapes</strong> along the Canal Saint-Martin, and the <strong>Bassin de l’Arsenal</strong> became creative enclaves where art, conviviality, and a unique relationship with the city intertwined.</p>\n<p>Today, there are approximately <strong>1,000 houseboats</strong> in Paris and its near suburbs. Life on the water remains as appealing as ever, despite the challenges: humidity, regular hull maintenance, and sometimes precarious moorings. For those who live on them, the daily spectacle of reflections on the water and the gentle rocking of the boat are more than worth the trade-offs.</p>\n<h2>Floating restaurants and party venues: the Seine as a stage</h2>\n<p><strong>Parisian péniches</strong> are not just homes. Since the 1990s, a thriving cultural and gastronomic economy has developed on the river. Barge-restaurants like the <strong>Pavillon Puebla</strong> and legendary venues like the <strong>Batofar</strong>, a former Irish lightship converted into a nightclub, have turned the riverbanks into hubs for nightlife and fine dining.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating restaurants</strong> have multiplied, offering a unique culinary experience with views of Parisian landmarks. Dining on a barge moored opposite Notre-Dame or sipping a cocktail while watching the sunset behind the Eiffel Tower: this is the promise behind the success of <strong>gastronomic life on the Seine</strong>. Péniches also host private events — weddings, corporate seminars, and birthday celebrations — continuing the centuries-old tradition of festivities on the water.</p>\n<p>This vibrant scene has given rise to a true <strong>Parisian art de vivre</strong>, where the river is no longer merely a backdrop but a central player in the experience. Enjoying an apéritif at the water’s edge, feeling the river breeze, hearing the water lap against the hull — these are the sensations that define a distinctly Parisian way of enjoying life.</p>\n<h2>The Sénang: a Dutch barge in the heart of Paris</h2>\n<p>Within this floating world, the <strong>Sénang</strong> holds a special place. This <strong>Dutch tjalk</strong>, a type of traditional flat-bottomed sailing vessel from the Netherlands, was built to navigate the canals and estuaries of Northern Europe. Tjalks were used from the 17th century onward to transport goods across the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, recognizable by their rounded hulls and their <em>leeboards</em>, the distinctive lateral keels.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Sénang</strong> has been fully renovated to begin a second life as a <strong>private cruise boat on the Seine</strong>. While preserving its authentic character as a traditional Dutch barge, it has been fitted out to welcome up to <strong>12 passengers</strong> in a warm, elegant setting. Its open deck offers a 360-degree view of Parisian landmarks, while its wooden interior preserves the cozy atmosphere of boats from a bygone era.</p>\n<p>Moored at the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong>, in Paris’s 12th arrondissement, the Sénang enjoys an ideal location. This marina, situated between the Place de la Bastille and the Seine, is itself steeped in history: a former basin dug under Charles X in the 1820s, it once connected the Canal Saint-Martin to the Seine before being converted into a marina in 1983.</p>\n<h2>The art of living on the Seine: apéritifs, sunsets, and private moments</h2>\n<p>What sets a <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> apart from any other Parisian experience is the intimate connection with the river and the city. Far from the large tourist boats and their hundreds of passengers, a private cruise recreates the atmosphere of a gathering among friends or family, at the peaceful rhythm of the water.</p>\n<p>Picture a <strong>sunset apéritif</strong>, a glass of champagne in hand, as the Sénang glides silently past the Île Saint-Louis bathed in golden light. Or an <strong>intimate birthday celebration</strong>, with the sparkling Eiffel Tower as the backdrop. This is the <strong>art of living</strong> that makes private navigation magical: time stands still, the city reveals itself in a new light, and every moment becomes a memory.</p>\n<p>This experience is part of a deeply Parisian tradition. From the bals musettes (accordion dance halls) along the banks of the Marne to the guinguettes (open-air riverside cafés) of Nogent, from royal nautical festivals to jazzy evenings on the péniches of Quai de la Gare, the French have always celebrated the <strong>art of living by the water</strong>. The private cruise is the most refined and intimate expression of this tradition.</p>\n<h2>Live the experience: board the Sénang</h2>\n<p>With <strong>Un Bateau à Paris</strong>, this <strong>art of living on the Seine</strong> is accessible to everyone. The Sénang offers <strong>private cruises</strong> lasting two hours, departing from the Port de l’Arsenal, five times a day. Whether for a <strong>romantic cruise</strong> for two, a family gathering, a corporate event, or a celebration among friends, the boat adapts to every occasion.</p>\n<p>Every cruise includes a glass of champagne or a welcome cocktail, and the route takes you past the most beautiful monuments of Paris as seen from the river: Notre-Dame, the Louvre, the Musée d’Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides. On board, you are at home, with the Seine as your garden and Paris as your backdrop. <a href=\"/reservation\">Book your private cruise</a> and experience this unique art of living, inherited from centuries of Parisian river tradition.</p>",

    "title": "The Seine, Lifeline of Paris: 2,000 Years of History on the Water",
    "excerpt": "From Lutetia to the 2024 Olympic Games, the Seine has shaped Paris for 2,000 years. Dive into the history of France’s most famous river, witness to every era.",
    "content": "<p>The <strong>Seine</strong> is not merely a river that crosses Paris: it is Paris. For two millennia, this 776-kilometer waterway has shaped the geography, economy, architecture, and very soul of the French capital. From <strong>Lutetia</strong> to the modern metropolis, every era has left its mark on its banks. To trace the <strong>history of the Seine</strong> is to journey through the entire history of France.</p>\n<h2>Lutetia: Paris is born on the Seine</h2>\n<p>The story begins on the <strong>Île de la Cité</strong>, the cradle of Paris. Around the 3rd century BCE, the Gallic tribe known as the Parisii settled on this island, naturally protected by the arms of the river. The location was strategic: the <strong>Seine</strong> allowed them to control trade between northern and southern Gaul.</p>\n<p>After the Roman conquest in 52 BCE, Lutetia developed on the Left Bank. The Romans built baths, a forum, and an amphitheater, but the river remained the driving force of the city. The <strong>Pillar of the Nautes</strong>, a votive monument erected by the boatmen’s guild in the 1st century, proves that the Seine was already at the center of economic and religious life. Discovered in 1711 beneath the choir of Notre-Dame, it is the oldest known monument in Paris.</p>\n<h2>The Middle Ages: the Seine feeds and protects Paris</h2>\n<p>During the Middle Ages, the <strong>Seine became the vital artery</strong> of a rapidly expanding city. The river supplied Paris with food, building materials, and fuel. Watermills multiplied beneath the bridges, while the water merchants gained considerable power. The <em>Hanse des marchands de l’eau</em> (Guild of Water Merchants), founded in the 12th century, controlled all river traffic and laid the foundations of the Parisian municipality.</p>\n<p>This was also the era of grand construction along the riverbanks. The building of <strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong> began in 1163, with stones arriving by river from the quarries of the Oise. The Louvre, initially a medieval fortress, was built along the Right Bank. The <strong>Sainte-Chapelle</strong>, a jewel of Rayonnant Gothic architecture, rose on the Île de la Cité in 1248. All these monuments, still admired today from the Seine, testify to the river’s central role in Parisian urban planning.</p>\n<p>The <strong>bridges of Paris</strong> also tell this story. The Pont-Neuf, despite its name (« New Bridge »), is the oldest standing bridge in Paris, inaugurated by Henry IV in 1607. The first bridge without houses, it offered an unobstructed view of the river for the first time, transforming the relationship between Parisians and their Seine.</p>\n<h2>The Great Works: Haussmann and the quays of the Seine</h2>\n<p>Under the Second Empire, Baron <strong>Haussmann</strong> radically transformed the face of Paris, and the Seine was no exception. Between 1853 and 1870, the banks were reinforced, the quays were lined with masonry and widened, and access routes to the river were redesigned. The <strong>quays of the Seine</strong> became true tree-lined promenades.</p>\n<p>Haussmann also ordered the construction of large sewer collectors that diverted wastewater away from the Seine, greatly improving the river’s sanitation. The bouquinistes (second-hand booksellers), already present since the 16th century, established themselves permanently on the quay parapets, creating the <strong>open-air bookshop</strong> that still defines the charm of the riverbanks today. In 1991, the <strong>banks of the Seine in Paris</strong> were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the ultimate recognition of the unique harmony between a river and its city.</p>\n<h2>1910: the great flood, Paris underwater</h2>\n<p>The <strong>history of the Seine</strong> is not only a story of glory. In January 1910, Paris endured one of its worst natural disasters. After weeks of rain, the river reached 8.62 meters at the Pont d’Austerlitz, compared to the normal 2 meters. The <strong>flood of 1910</strong> submerged entire neighborhoods: the Marais, the Gare Saint-Lazare, and part of the 7th arrondissement were underwater.</p>\n<p>The Zouave statue on the Pont de l’Alma, a military figure installed in 1856, then became the popular benchmark for the Seine’s water level. When « the Zouave’s feet are in the water, » Parisians start worrying. In 1910, the water reached his shoulders. The city took months to recover from this historic flood, and the threat of another great flood is still taken very seriously by authorities.</p>\n<h2>The Seine today: living heritage and a place of wonder</h2>\n<p>In the 21st century, the <strong>Seine</strong> is experiencing a genuine renaissance. The pedestrian riverbanks, inaugurated on the Left Bank in 2013, have given the river back to Parisians and strollers. <strong>Péniches</strong> (traditional barges) have been transformed into living spaces, restaurants, and cultural venues. In 2024, the Seine took center stage during the <strong>opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games</strong>, a historic nautical parade that consecrated the river as the capital’s most beautiful avenue.</p>\n<p>Swimming in the Seine, banned since 1923, has become a concrete goal once again, a sign that the river is regaining an environmental quality lost for a century. Paris is reconnecting with its waterway, and the <strong>Seine is once again a place of life</strong>, celebration, and discovery.</p>\n<p>To take in these <strong>2,000 years of history</strong> in a single glance, nothing rivals a cruise on the river. From the deck of a boat, every bridge, every monument, every quay tells a chapter of the great Parisian adventure. With <strong>Un Bateau à Paris</strong>, board the Sénang departing from the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong> for a private cruise that transforms the river into an open-air history book. <a href=\"/croisiere\">Discover our cruise packages</a> and live this unique experience with friends or family, on the water and through the ages.</p>",

    "title": "History of Navigation on the Seine: From Royal Barges to Private Cruises",
    "excerpt": "From medieval boats to modern private cruises, navigation on the Seine tells over a thousand years of history. Discover how this legendary river became the most beautiful waterway in Paris.",
    "content": "<p><strong>Navigation on the Seine</strong> is inseparable from the history of Paris. For over a millennium, the river has carried kings, merchants, artists, and travelers. Even today, sailing its waters remains one of the most enchanting ways to discover the capital. Here is a look back at a <strong>fascinating history</strong>, from royal barges to <strong>private cruises on the Seine</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Medieval origins: merchants and the Parisian nautes</h2>\n<p>The history of <strong>navigation on the Seine</strong> dates back to antiquity. The Parisii, the Gallic tribe that gave Paris its name, were already skilled boatmen. After the Roman conquest, Lutetia prospered thanks to river trade. The corporation of <strong>Parisian nautes</strong> (boatmen), documented as early as the 1st century by the famous Pillar of the Nautes discovered beneath Notre-Dame, bears witness to this ancestral activity.</p>\n<p>During the Middle Ages, the Seine became the economic lifeline of Paris. <strong>Cargo boats</strong> transported wood, wine, wheat, and building stone. The powerful guild of water merchants, forerunner of the Parisian municipality, controlled river traffic. Their motto, <em>Fluctuat nec mergitur</em> (« She is tossed by the waves but does not sink »), would become the motto of the city of Paris itself. Ports multiplied along the banks: the grain port, the wine port, the hay port. Each quay had its specialty, and the river teemed with activity from dawn to dusk.</p>\n<h2>Royal boats and festivities on the water</h2>\n<p>From the Renaissance onward, the Seine welcomed a new kind of navigation: <strong>royal vessels</strong>. Francis I, Henry IV, and Louis XIV used sumptuously decorated barges for their travels and receptions. <strong>Nautical festivals</strong> became a prized spectacle at court. In 1518, Francis I organized a grand naval joust in front of the Louvre to impress foreign ambassadors.</p>\n<p>Under Louis XIV, <strong>royal gondolas</strong> cruised the Seine during lavish ceremonies. The Sun King even brought Venetian gondoliers to enliven his festivities. These vessels, adorned with gilding and sculptures, foreshadowed the art of <strong>luxury cruising</strong> on the Parisian river. The tradition of waterborne receptions was born — a tradition that endures today in a more intimate form through <strong>private cruises</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The 19th century: the golden age of river transport</h2>\n<p>The Industrial Revolution radically transformed <strong>navigation on the Seine</strong>. In 1816, the first steamboat, the Charles-Philippe, traveled up the river between Paris and Montereau. It was a revolution. <strong>Steamboats</strong> gradually replaced sailing vessels and rowboats, making navigation faster and more regular.</p>\n<p>In 1867, during the Paris World’s Fair, Jean-Sébastien Mouche launched his famous <strong>bateaux-mouches</strong> (sightseeing boats) on the Seine. Built in the Mouche district of Lyon, these boats offered <strong>tourist excursions</strong> to the general public for the first time. The success was immediate: thousands of Parisians and visitors discovered the city from the water. The bateaux-mouches would become an institution, though the concept of tourist cruising on the Seine is even older, rooted in centuries of river tradition.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <strong>floating laundries</strong>, floating baths, and riverside guinguettes (open-air dance halls) made the Seine a lively gathering place. The river was not merely a transport route: it was the beating heart of Parisian life.</p>\n<h2>The 20th century: decline and rebirth of the Seine</h2>\n<p>The rise of railways and automobiles in the 20th century gradually marginalized <strong>river transport</strong>. Commercial traffic declined, and the expressways built along the riverbanks in 1967 distanced Parisians from their river. The Seine seemed destined to become nothing more than a backdrop.</p>\n<p>Yet <strong>pleasure boating</strong> took over. Péniches (traditional barges) were converted into homes, tourist cruises modernized, and a new kind of navigation emerged: the <strong>private cruise</strong>. Far from the crowded tourist boats, human-scale vessels offered an intimate, personalized experience on the river.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the left bank promenades were returned to pedestrians. In 2024, the Seine hosted the <strong>opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games</strong>, consecrating the river as a world stage. Navigation on the Seine has never been more alive.</p>\n<h2>Today: the private cruise, heir to a long tradition</h2>\n<p><strong>Private cruises on the Seine</strong> are a direct continuation of this thousand-year history. Like the royal barges of old, they offer an exclusive experience, far from the crowds, close to the water and the monuments. Boarding a private boat means reconnecting with a tradition of <strong>intimate, elegant navigation</strong> that spans the centuries.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Un Bateau à Paris</strong>, this tradition comes to life aboard the Sénang, a traditional Dutch barge moored at the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong>, in the heart of the 12th arrondissement. Accommodating up to 12 passengers, the Sénang carries on the centuries-old art of cruising the Seine in an authentic, warm setting. Whether you wish to celebrate an event or simply admire Paris from the river, <a href=\"/reservation\">book a private cruise</a> and write your own chapter in the great history of <strong>navigation on the Seine</strong>.</p>",

    "title": "Winter refit 2025–2026 of the Sénang: a season in the boatyard",
    "excerpt": "Every winter, the Sénang enters the boatyard for a full refit. Hull painting, varnish, safety equipment and navigation instruments: discover the behind-the-scenes of our Dutch tjalk’s winter maintenance.",
    "content": "<p>While Paris wraps itself in its winter coat, the Sénang lives its own season: that of the <strong>winter refit</strong>. Every year, our 12-metre Dutch tjalk receives a complete overhaul — an age-old maritime tradition that guarantees our passengers safety, comfort and beauty on every cruise. Here is a behind-the-scenes look at the <strong>2025–2026 refit of the Sénang</strong>.</p>\n<h2>A maritime tradition: the boat’s winter maintenance</h2>\n<p>In the world of sailing, winter is the season of care. It is a tradition as old as seafaring itself: when waters cool and pleasure boating pauses, boats enter the yard to be inspected, repaired and beautified. For the Sénang, this period is sacred. It is the guarantee of quality and reliability that we owe our passengers.</p>\n<p>The winter refit is not a simple clean-up. It is a <strong>complete restoration</strong>, methodical and exacting, covering every aspect of the boat: hull, deck, woodwork, hardware, safety equipment and navigation instruments. Nothing is left to chance.</p>\n<h2>Hull painting: protection and beauty</h2>\n<p>The first major project this winter concerns the <strong>hull painting</strong>. The Sénang was lifted out of the water to allow full access to her steel hull. The process begins with meticulous stripping of the old paint layers, followed by rigorous anti-corrosion treatment.</p>\n<p>Next comes the application of <strong>antifouling</strong>, the special paint that prevents marine organisms from attaching to the hull. This is a crucial element for sailing performance and preservation of the boat’s structure. Finally, the finishing coats restore the Sénang’s traditional colours, true to the heritage of Dutch tjalks.</p>\n<h3>Artisan craftsmanship</h3>\n<p>Hull painting is a craft in its own right. The artisans working on the Sénang master the traditional techniques of marine painting. Each coat is applied under precise conditions of temperature and humidity, with drying times scrupulously observed. The result is a hull that is both <strong>perfectly protected and beautifully finished</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Varnish restoration: bringing the woodwork back to life</h2>\n<p>The Sénang owes much of its charm to its <strong>teak and fine-wood joinery</strong>. The bulwarks, coamings, coach roof and deck fittings — wood is everywhere and contributes to the warm, authentic atmosphere of the boat. But wood on water is put to a harsh test. UV rays, humidity, temperature swings and spray constantly attack the varnish.</p>\n<p>Varnish restoration is a work of patience and precision. The old coats are sanded by hand, grit by grit, until the bare wood is revealed. Then come the new coats of marine varnish, a product specially formulated to withstand river conditions. <strong>Five to seven coats</strong> are needed to achieve optimal shine and protection.</p>\n<p>The result is spectacular: the woodwork regains its golden lustre, its grain stands out with clarity, and the Sénang gleams as on its very first day. It is a feast for the eyes that our passengers appreciate the moment they step aboard.</p>\n<h2>Safety equipment: the absolute priority</h2>\n<p>The beauty of the Sénang would be nothing without the <strong>safety of its passengers</strong>. Winter is the opportunity for a full overhaul of all safety equipment on board. Every item is inspected, tested and replaced if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Life jackets</strong> are checked one by one: fabric condition, inflation system operation, integrity of straps and buckles. <strong>Fire extinguishers</strong> are inspected and recharged to current standards. The <strong>first-aid kit</strong> is restocked with fresh supplies. <strong>Navigation lights</strong> — the regulatory lights that signal a vessel’s position and heading at night — are tested and replaced if needed.</p>\n<p>We go beyond regulatory requirements. Safety aboard the Sénang is not an administrative formality: it is a <em>deep conviction</em>. Our passengers must be able to enjoy their cruise with complete peace of mind, and that begins with a boat that is irreproachable in terms of safety.</p>\n<h2>Navigation instruments: technology in the service of tradition</h2>\n<p>While the Sénang is a traditional boat in soul and aesthetics, it carries <strong>modern navigation technology</strong> in the service of safety and comfort. This winter, we are updating and inspecting all instruments.</p>\n<p>The <strong>GPS</strong> is checked and updated with the latest river charts. The <strong>VHF radio</strong>, essential for communication with locks, other vessels and port authorities, is tested on all frequencies. The <strong>depth sounder</strong> is recalibrated to ensure precise readings of the Seine’s riverbed. These instruments, invisible to passengers, are essential to the smooth running of every cruise.</p>\n<h2>Maritime craftsmanship: expert hands in the service of the Sénang</h2>\n<p>The Sénang’s winter refit calls upon <strong>artisans specialising in river craft</strong>. Painters, varnishers, mechanics, marine electricians — each brings their expertise and their love of a job well done. These trades, sometimes little known, perpetuate precious know-how. Working on a Dutch tjalk like the Sénang means touching the history of European navigation, and our artisans are fully aware of it.</p>\n<h2>The Sénang will return in spring 2026 more beautiful than ever</h2>\n<p>At the end of this winter refit, the Sénang will return to her berth at the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong> in Paris’s 12th arrondissement, ready for a new season of private cruises on the Seine. Immaculate hull, gleaming woodwork, brand-new equipment: our Dutch tjalk will be more beautiful and safer than ever to welcome you aboard.</p>\n<p>We cannot wait to see you on board. In the meantime, you can already browse our <a href=\"/croisiere\">cruise packages</a> and plan your next escape on the Seine. Our private cruises, starting from €480 for up to 12 passengers, await you as soon as the fine weather returns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your cruise for spring 2026</a> and be among the first to rediscover the Sénang in all its restored splendour. Also explore our <a href=\"/galerie\">photo gallery</a> for a glimpse of what awaits you on board.</p>",

    "title": "Boat aperitif on the Seine: a guide to Parisian art de vivre",
    "excerpt": "Champagne, sunset and Parisian monuments: the boat aperitif on the Seine elevates French art de vivre to new heights. A complete guide to an unforgettable aperitif aboard the Sénang, departing from the Port de l’Arsenal.",
    "content": "<p>There is a French tradition that the whole world envies: the <strong>apéro</strong>. That sacred moment, tucked between the end of the day and dinner, when you take the time to gather around a glass and a few bites. In Paris, the apéro is enjoyed on terraces, along the quays, in hidden courtyards. But there is a superior version, an art form in its own right: the <em>boat aperitif on the Seine</em>. Aboard the Sénang, an authentic Dutch tjalk moored at the Port de l’Arsenal, the Parisian aperitif reaches its most accomplished expression.</p>\n<h2>The boat aperitif: much more than a simple drink</h2>\n<p>Forget the usual bar counter and the terrace where you fight for a seat. The boat aperitif is an <strong>immersive experience</strong> that engages all the senses. The lapping of water against the hull, the light breeze brushing your skin, the scent of the Seine mingling with the bubbles of champagne sparkling in your glass. It is watching Paris drift slowly by, monument after monument, bridge after bridge, like a film in which you are the lead character.</p>\n<p>On the Sénang, the aperitif takes on a private and exclusive dimension. No tourists with selfie sticks, no loudspeakers broadcasting commentary in eight languages. Just you, your loved ones — <strong>up to 12 guests</strong> — and the most beautiful avenue in the world unfolding before your eyes. The welcome champagne is served, toasts are raised, and the evening may begin.</p>\n<h2>The golden hour: the perfect moment to embark</h2>\n<p>It is all a matter of <em>timing</em>. The finest boat aperitif is experienced at the <strong>golden hour</strong>, that magical moment when the sun begins its descent and bathes Paris in a warm, almost unreal light. The cut-stone façades of Haussmann buildings take on hues of honey, the Seine becomes a golden mirror, and the silhouettes of bridges stand out against a picture-postcard sky.</p>\n<p>In summer, the golden hour stretches out languidly: the ideal boarding time is between 7 pm and 8 pm, to enjoy the fading light and then the city’s gradual illumination. In autumn and spring, the sun sets earlier, offering cruises that begin in daylight and end amid the enchantment of illuminated monuments. It is precisely this <strong>transition between day and night</strong> that makes the boat aperitif so spectacular.</p>\n<h2>Aboard the Sénang: a unique art of hospitality</h2>\n<p>The Sénang is no ordinary boat. This <strong>12-metre Dutch tjalk</strong> possesses a soul, a history, a character. Its spacious deck offers an unobstructed 360-degree view of the Seine and its banks. Comfortable bench seats invite you to settle in for the duration of the cruise. Should it turn cool, the bimini top — that protective canopy — deploys to create a warm cocoon without sacrificing the view.</p>\n<p>From the moment you board, the mood is set: a glass of champagne or a welcome cocktail, carefully prepared canapés, and, if you wish, a musical playlist to accompany the voyage. Everything is designed so that you have <em>absolutely nothing to do</em> but savour the moment. The captain takes the helm; you take charge of living the instant.</p>\n<h2>The itinerary: a parade of monuments</h2>\n<p>Departure is from the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong>, nestled between the Bastille and the Seine in Paris’s 12th arrondissement. This discreet and charming embarkation point is in itself a discovery for many Parisians. Then the cruise begins, and the spectacle unfolds.</p>\n<p>The Île Saint-Louis appears first, with its quays lined with 17th-century private mansions. Then <strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong> rises up, majestic, its restoration works a testament to the capital’s resilience. The Sénang glides beneath the Pont Neuf — the oldest bridge in Paris, despite its name — before passing along the <strong>Louvre</strong> and the Tuileries Garden.</p>\n<p>On the Left Bank, the <strong>Musée d’Orsay</strong> reveals its former railway-station façade. Further on, the <strong>Invalides</strong> and their gilded dome catch the last rays of the sun. And finally, as a crowning moment, the <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> reveals itself in all its splendour. When it begins to sparkle, exclamations ring out on board. It is a moment of pure emotion, even for those who have seen it a thousand times.</p>\n<h2>Why it is incomparable with a bar or restaurant</h2>\n<p>You could take your aperitif at a Parisian rooftop with a view over the rooftops. You could book a terrace table beside the Seine. But nothing replaces <strong>movement</strong>. On a boat, the scenery changes constantly. Every second offers a new frame, a new angle, a new perspective on the city.</p>\n<p>There is also the <strong>intimacy</strong>. In a bar, you share the space with dozens of strangers. On the Sénang, you are at home. You speak freely, laugh loudly, dance if the mood takes you. The boat is your <em>private bubble</em> in the heart of the most beautiful city in the world. This sensation of freedom, of floating — in every sense of the word — is unique and addictive.</p>\n<h2>Practical tips for your boat aperitif</h2>\n<h3>What to wear?</h3>\n<p>Opt for a chic yet comfortable outfit. Flat shoes are recommended on the boat deck. In the evening, even in summer, bring a light jacket or shawl: the breeze on the Seine is pleasantly refreshing but can catch you off guard.</p>\n<h3>Which season to choose?</h3>\n<p>Spring and summer offer the longest and mildest evenings, with spectacular sunsets. Autumn brings extraordinary low-angle light and tawny hues along the quays. In winter, with the bimini top deployed and a warm drink in hand, the boat aperitif takes on the feel of a <strong>cosy cocoon cruise</strong>, with Christmas illuminations as a bonus.</p>\n<h3>What to bring?</h3>\n<p>Your good spirits, essentially. Everything else — champagne, glassware, setup — is taken care of. You may of course bring a cake for a birthday or special decorations. Do not forget your camera: the opportunities for exceptional shots are countless.</p>\n<h2>For whom? For every desire</h2>\n<p>A boat aperitif on the Seine needs no excuse. It is perfect for a <strong>group of friends</strong> who want to mark an occasion, for a <strong>couple</strong> seeking a moment apart, for a <strong>small celebration</strong> — a promotion, a reunion, a farewell — or simply for the pleasure of living an exceptional Parisian moment.</p>\n<p>It is also an extraordinary gift idea. To offer a boat aperitif on the Seine is to offer a memory, an emotion, an enchanted interlude. Few gifts can rival it. <a href=\"/apero-bateau-seine\">Discover our boat aperitif package</a> or combine it with a <a href=\"/coucher-soleil-seine\">sunset on the Seine</a> for an even more memorable experience.</p>\n<h2>Art de vivre, Seine-side</h2>\n<p>A boat aperitif on the Seine is the quintessence of <strong>Parisian art de vivre</strong>. It is taking the time, savouring the moment, contemplating the beauty around you. It is transforming a simple drink among friends into an exceptional occasion. Aboard the Sénang, with Paris drifting past and the sun descending, every sip tastes different, every laugh rings louder, every second matters more.</p>\n<p>Private cruises are available <strong>from €480</strong> for the entire boat. Shared among friends, this represents a remarkably gentle cost per person for an experience you will never forget.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your boat aperitif on the Seine</a></strong> and discover why those who have experienced it never want to take their aperitif any other way.</p>",

    "excerpt": "Birthday, hen party, romantic evening or team building: discover the five ideal occasions to charter a boat on the Seine. The Sénang, a 12-metre Dutch tjalk, welcomes up to 12 passengers from the Port de l’Arsenal.",
    "content": "<p>Paris can be discovered in a thousand ways, but none rivals the magic of a private cruise on the Seine. Picture this: you step aboard an authentic 12-metre Dutch tjalk, the <strong>Sénang</strong>, moored at the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong> in Paris’s 12th arrondissement. The mooring lines are cast off, and the City of Light unfolds before your eyes, monument after monument, bridge after bridge. This privilege, once reserved for a select few, is now within reach for all your special occasions. Here are the five life moments that deserve a celebration on the water.</p>\n<h2>1. An unforgettable hen party on the Seine</h2>\n<p>A hen party is much more than a girls’ night out: it is the last great moment of freedom before the wedding, the one that will still be talked about twenty years from now. And what better backdrop than the Seine to celebrate it? Aboard the Sénang, the hen party takes on a unique dimension. No queues, no nosy neighbours at the next table: <strong>the boat is entirely privatised</strong> for your group, up to 12 guests.</p>\n<p>Imagine the bride-to-be discovering the surprise on the quay at the Port de l’Arsenal. Laughter erupts the moment everyone boards, the champagne flows, and music accompanies your passage beneath the bridges of Paris. You glide past the Île Saint-Louis, Notre-Dame, the Louvre… The setting is spectacular, the photos will be sublime, and the atmosphere remains <em>intimate</em> — exactly what is needed for a cherished moment among friends.</p>\n<p>Decorations, a personalised playlist, catering: everything can be arranged to your wishes. A hen party on the Seine is the guarantee of a memory etched forever. <a href=\"/evjf-seine\">Discover our hen party on the Seine package</a> and start planning the celebration.</p>\n<h2>2. A romantic cruise for two</h2>\n<p>Paris is the world capital of love, and the Seine is its main artery. A <strong>private romantic cruise</strong> on the Sénang means offering your other half a moment out of time, far from the bustle of packed restaurants and noisy terraces. Here, the tête-à-tête is absolute.</p>\n<p>Whether it is for a marriage proposal — imagine getting down on one knee as the Eiffel Tower sparkles on the horizon —, a dating anniversary or simply a declaration of love, the setting speaks for itself. The deck of the Sénang becomes your private lounge, with a panoramic view of the capital’s most beautiful monuments. The sun descends gently, the Haussmann façades turn gold, and time stands still.</p>\n<p>Add a bottle of champagne, a few candles, a soft playlist, and you have the most romantic evening of your life. No need for fancy words: the Seine does the rest. <a href=\"/croisiere-romantique-seine\">Explore our romantic cruise on the Seine</a> to prepare your surprise.</p>\n<h2>3. A birthday celebrated on the water</h2>\n<p>Blowing out your candles on a boat, with Paris as a backdrop: now that is a birthday idea that truly stands out. The Sénang welcomes up to <strong>12 guests</strong>, making it the perfect setting for an intimate and warm celebration. No hundreds of unknown guests, no impersonal function room: just your loved ones, gathered on the deck of a magnificent Dutch tjalk.</p>\n<p>Milestone birthdays — 30, 40, 50 — deserve a setting worthy of the occasion. But a birthday on the Seine does not need a round number to be memorable. Every year counts, and every voyage is different: the light changes, the seasons turn, and Paris constantly reinvents itself when seen from the water.</p>\n<p>Cake, buffet, entertainment: you compose the celebration as you see fit. The captain takes care of the navigation; you take care of enjoying yourself. It is as simple as that. <a href=\"/anniversaire-seine\">Organise your birthday on the Seine</a> right now.</p>\n<h2>4. An original team building away from the office</h2>\n<p>Meeting-room seminars, escape games you have already done three times, company bowling: let us be honest, team building often lacks inspiration. A <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> changes the game entirely. The moment your colleagues step onto the deck of the Sénang, office codes fade away. Hierarchies relax, conversations become natural, and team cohesion builds on its own.</p>\n<p>The format is ideal for small teams: up to 12 people, precisely the right size for a management committee, a project team or a group of managers. The atmosphere is at once <em>professional and relaxed</em>, conducive to genuine exchanges. You brainstorm better with the spire of Notre-Dame in the background — it has been proven.</p>\n<p>Welcome cocktail, informal presentation, creative workshop on deck: the possibilities are many. And when your colleagues recount their day at home, they will not say “we did a team building” but “we sailed the Seine.” The difference is considerable. <a href=\"/team-building-seine\">Discover our team building on the Seine package</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. A sunset cruise</h2>\n<p>There is a precise moment, every day, when Paris transforms. Parisians call it the <em>golden hour</em>: that fleeting window when the sun dips behind the rooftops, flooding the city with a warm, coppery light. From the Seine, this spectacle is simply <strong>breathtaking</strong>.</p>\n<p>A sunset cruise aboard the Sénang is a complete sensory experience. The sky shifts from blue to pink, then to orange and violet. Reflections dance on the water, monuments light up one by one, and the Eiffel Tower begins to sparkle. You have the best seat in the house for the most beautiful show in Paris, a glass in hand, a gentle breeze in your hair.</p>\n<p>This cruise suits every occasion — or no particular one at all. Sometimes the finest gift you can give yourself is simply taking the time to contemplate. A sunset on the Seine cannot be told: it must be lived. <a href=\"/coucher-soleil-seine\">Book your sunset cruise</a> and let Paris do the rest.</p>\n<h2>The Sénang: your setting for every occasion</h2>\n<p>Whatever the occasion, the <strong>Sénang</strong> is far more than a boat: it is a living space, a place of emotion, a backdrop that no restaurant or reception hall can match. This authentic Dutch tjalk, with its spacious deck and warm interior, transforms every event into an imperishable memory.</p>\n<p>With <strong>private cruises starting from €480</strong> for the entire boat, the dream is more accessible than you might think. Shared among friends, colleagues or as a couple, the price per person remains remarkably gentle for an experience that is absolutely unique in Paris.</p>\n<p>So, what will your next occasion be? <strong><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your private cruise on the Seine</a></strong> and treat yourself to Paris seen from the water.</p>",

    "title": "Concert on the Seine: Billet Doux plays on the water",
    "excerpt": "The band Billet Doux took to the deck of the Sénang for an intimate acoustic concert on the Seine. Live music, sunset and illuminated bridges: a look back at an evening that embodies the spirit of Un Bateau à Paris.",
    "content": "<p>Some evenings leave a lasting mark. The night the band <strong>Billet Doux</strong> played an acoustic set on the deck of the Sénang, gliding slowly beneath the illuminated bridges of Paris at sunset, is undoubtedly one of them. This <strong>concert on the Seine</strong> captures the very essence of what we strive to offer at Un Bateau à Paris: unique, intimate and deeply Parisian experiences.</p>\n<h2>A magical setting: live music on the Seine at dusk</h2>\n<p>Picture the scene. The Sénang gently leaves the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong> as the sun begins its descent behind the rooftops of Paris. The Haussmann façades glow gold and pink. On the deck of the Dutch tjalk, the musicians of Billet Doux tune their instruments. The first chords ring out over the water as the boat glides onto the Seine.</p>\n<p>The music blends with the lapping of waves against the hull, with the murmur of the city fading into the distance. Beneath the Pont d’Austerlitz, the notes bounce off century-old stone, creating a striking natural acoustic. It is a suspended moment, <em>one of those instants when Paris reveals itself in all its beauty</em>.</p>\n<h2>Billet Doux: acoustic intimacy on the water</h2>\n<p>The choice of Billet Doux for this evening was no accident. The band performs sensitive acoustic music, woven from delicate melodies and finely crafted lyrics, perfectly suited to the intimate atmosphere of a cruise aboard the Sénang. Their sound, at once warm and airy, converses naturally with the river setting.</p>\n<p>On a boat, music takes on a special dimension. Sound travels across the water, the reverberations of bridges add unexpected depth, and the absence of urban noise leaves every note room to breathe. The musicians themselves confided that they had experienced something extraordinary, <strong>playing in a setting that no concert hall could ever replicate</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The Sénang: a floating concert hall for 12 privileged guests</h2>\n<p>What makes these concerts on the Seine truly exceptional is the Sénang’s capacity. With a maximum of <strong>12 passengers</strong>, every person on board has a front-row seat. There is no bad spot, no distance between the artists and the audience. You are together, sharing the same breath, carried by the music and the current of the Seine.</p>\n<p>This intimacy is the Sénang’s signature. Our 12-metre Dutch tjalk is not designed for crowds: it is made for <strong>rare and precious moments</strong>. A private concert on the Seine aboard the Sénang is the very antithesis of a packed sightseeing boat. It is a privilege that only a handful of people in the world can experience.</p>\n<h3>The natural acoustics of the Seine</h3>\n<p>Professional musicians know it well: water is an extraordinary natural amplifier. Sound propagates with remarkable clarity across the surface of the Seine. Add to that the natural vault formed by the arches of Parisian bridges, and you obtain acoustics that the finest concert halls would envy. Each passage beneath a bridge becomes a sonic event, a musical surprise that the artists learn to use and that passengers remember long afterwards.</p>\n<h2>Champagne, music and monuments: an exceptional evening</h2>\n<p>While Billet Doux played, passengers savoured a glass of champagne, comfortably settled on deck. The Île Saint-Louis drifted past to starboard, majestic in the light of the setting sun. Then Notre-Dame appeared, its reconstruction scaffolding a testament to Parisian resilience. Camera flashes from tourists on the quays punctuated the gathering night while the music continued, soft and enveloping.</p>\n<p>It is this <strong>unique combination</strong> — live music, champagne, the sunset, monuments gliding slowly past — that creates the magic of a musical cruise on the Seine. No restaurant, no rooftop, no bar can offer this experience. It exists only on the water.</p>\n<h2>Your cruise, your musical atmosphere</h2>\n<p>This concert with Billet Doux perfectly illustrates what we offer at Un Bateau à Paris: <strong>fully bespoke private cruises</strong>. Do you dream of an acoustic concert at sunset? An electro DJ set under the stars? A jazz quartet for a birthday? A violinist for a marriage proposal? Anything is possible aboard the Sénang.</p>\n<p>We work with you to create the cruise that reflects who you are. The Sénang becomes your private stage, your floating lounge, your bubble of excellence on the Seine. Music is just one example of the countless possibilities offered by a private charter of the Sénang.</p>\n<h3>More than a cruise: a bespoke experience</h3>\n<p>This is what sets Un Bateau à Paris apart from other Seine cruise offerings. We do not offer a standardised product. We create with you a <strong>unique moment</strong>, thoughtfully designed down to the smallest detail, crafted in your image. Whether for a corporate event, a family celebration or an evening among friends, the Sénang is the setting for your finest Parisian memories.</p>\n<h2>Set sail for your own concert on the Seine</h2>\n<p>Tempted by a <strong>private musical cruise on the Seine</strong>? Contact us to imagine together your ideal evening. Our private cruises are available from €480 and welcome up to 12 passengers for a truly intimate experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your private cruise</a> and let yourself be carried by the music, the current and the magic of Paris seen from the water. The Sénang is waiting just for you.</p>",

    "title": "The Sénang’s new bimini top: all-season comfort on the Seine",
    "excerpt": "The Sénang now features an elegant new bimini top for comfortable cruises in every season. Spring showers, summer sun or autumn light — your private cruise on the Seine is now sheltered without losing any of the panoramic view.",
    "content": "<p>At Un Bateau à Paris, we are constantly striving to enhance our passengers’ experience. That is why we are proud to announce the installation of a <strong>new bimini top on the Sénang</strong>, our 12-metre Dutch tjalk moored at the Port de l’Arsenal in Paris’s 12th arrondissement. This major upgrade now allows you to fully enjoy our <strong>private cruises on the Seine in every season</strong>, regardless of the whims of Parisian weather.</p>\n<h2>What is a bimini top and why is it essential?</h2>\n<p>A bimini top — sometimes called a <em>sun awning</em> or deck canopy — is a textile shelter installed above the passenger area of a boat. It serves a dual purpose: <strong>providing shade</strong> on sunny days and <strong>sheltering from rain</strong> when Parisian skies turn fickle. On a river cruise boat, it is a feature that fundamentally transforms onboard comfort.</p>\n<p>Unlike the large, fully glazed sightseeing boats, the Sénang offers an open-air experience, close to the water and the monuments. The bimini top preserves this unique proximity with the Seine while ensuring effective protection from the elements.</p>\n<h2>Why did we install this new bimini top?</h2>\n<p>Paris is a magnificent city in every season, and the Seine takes on different lights throughout the year. We did not want our cruises to be limited to fine-weather days alone. With this new bimini top, we can now offer <strong>comfortable cruises from spring to autumn</strong>, and even on mild winter days.</p>\n<p>Spring showers? You stay dry while admiring the reflections of rain on the Seine. July sunshine? You enjoy welcome shade as Paris glides past your eyes. The soft light of October? The bimini top stays discreet, letting the golden glow of a Parisian autumn pour in.</p>\n<h2>An elegant design true to the Sénang’s spirit</h2>\n<p>The Sénang is an <strong>authentic Dutch tjalk</strong>, a boat of character whose traditional aesthetics are an integral part of the experience. Installing equipment that would detract from its appearance was out of the question. Our new bimini top was custom-made from quality marine fabric whose shade harmonises perfectly with the boat’s woodwork and hull.</p>\n<p>The structure, both sturdy and lightweight, <strong>does not obstruct the panoramic view in any way</strong>. Whether seated or standing, your gaze sweeps freely across the quays of the Seine, the illuminated bridges and the Parisian monuments. The bimini top fades from notice, leaving nothing but the spectacle of Paris seen from the water.</p>\n<h3>Materials built to last</h3>\n<p>The selected fabric is a technical marine-grade textile, UV-resistant, waterproof and treated against mould. The brushed stainless-steel hoops resist river corrosion. The entire assembly is removable for the Sénang’s winter maintenance, ensuring optimal longevity of the equipment.</p>\n<h2>A cruise enhanced in every season</h2>\n<p>This new bimini top truly transforms the onboard experience. Picture an <strong>evening aperitif cruise in May</strong>: a few drops of rain begin to fall, but under the bimini top you continue savouring your champagne while the lights of the Bastille reflect in the puddles on the quay. Or imagine a <strong>luncheon on the water in midsummer</strong>: the sun beats down, but in the shade of the bimini top a fresh breeze from the Seine wraps pleasantly around you.</p>\n<p>For our event cruises — birthdays, marriage proposals, corporate seminars — the bimini top also adds a cosy, cocoon-like touch that reinforces the private and exclusive character of the experience. Up to <strong>12 passengers</strong> enjoy a sheltered and convivial space, lulled by the gentle lapping of the water.</p>\n<h2>A jewel visible from the Port de l’Arsenal</h2>\n<p>The Sénang is moored at the <strong>Port de l’Arsenal</strong>, that beautiful marina nestled between the Place de la Bastille and the Seine. The new bimini top adds an elegant silhouette to the boat, which you can spot while strolling along the port. If you are in the neighbourhood, do come and admire the Sénang in its new attire.</p>\n<p>You can also discover the bimini top in photos on our Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bateau_a_paris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@bateau_a_paris</a>, where we regularly share pictures of the Sénang and our cruises on the Seine.</p>\n<h2>Book your all-season cruise</h2>\n<p>Thanks to this new bimini top, there is no longer a bad season to step aboard the Sénang. Whether you wish to organise a <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> for a special event or simply enjoy an exceptional moment among friends, we welcome you with the comfort and elegance that are the hallmark of Un Bateau à Paris.</p>\n<p>Discover all our <a href=\"/croisiere\">cruise packages</a> starting from €480 and <a href=\"/reservation\">book now</a> your next escape on the Seine.

    "content": "<p><strong>The Pont Neuf</strong> is one of the most iconic and oldest bridges in Paris. It spans the Seine and connects the Île de la Cité to both the right and left banks. Here are some facts and features about the Pont Neuf:</p>\n<li><strong>History:</strong> Contrary to what its name might suggest (« Neuf » meaning « new » in French), it is the oldest arch bridge in Paris. Its construction began in 1578 under King Henry III and was completed in 1607 under Henry IV. It owes its name to the fact that it was the « new » bridge compared to the older bridges that existed in Paris at the time.</li>\n<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> It is characterised by its 12 semicircular arches. It consists of two distinct parts: one with semicircular arches and another with segmental arches. The structure is made of stone and features pointed cutwater platforms that allow passers-by to stop and enjoy the view.</li>\n<li><strong>Decorations and Statuary:</strong> The bridge is decorated with mascarons (sculpted masks) on the arches, as well as numerous statues on its sides. These statues depict French sovereigns, historical events, and mythological deities.</li>\n<li><strong>Place Dauphine:</strong> The Pont Neuf is connected to Place Dauphine, a charming triangular square on the Île de la Cité. This square is surrounded by picturesque houses and is a pleasant spot for a pause.</li>\n<li><strong>Île de la Cité:</strong> The Pont Neuf is the entry point to the Île de la Cité, where major sites such as Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Sainte-Chapelle, and the Conciergerie are located.</li>\n<li><strong>Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf:</strong> The Pont Neuf has an interesting distinction: it was both the last bridge built before the French Revolution and the first after the Revolution.</li>\n<li><strong>Events and Activities:</strong> The Pont Neuf is often the venue for cultural activities, street performances, and various events, making it a lively place appreciated by Parisians and visitors alike.</li>\n<p>The Pont Neuf remains a symbol of Parisian history and architecture, and it also offers a magnificent view of the Seine and several iconic monuments of the city.</p>",
