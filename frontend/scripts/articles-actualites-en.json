    "excerpt": "The Sénang now features an elegant new bimini top for comfortable cruises in every season. Spring showers, summer sun or autumn light — your private cruise on the Seine is now sheltered without losing any of the panoramic view.",
    "content": "<p>At Un Bateau à Paris, we are constantly striving to enhance our passengers' experience. That is why we are proud to announce the installation of a <strong>new bimini top on the Sénang</strong>, our 12-metre Dutch tjalk moored at the Port de l'Arsenal in Paris's 12th arrondissement. This major upgrade now allows you to fully enjoy our <strong>private cruises on the Seine in every season</strong>, regardless of the whims of Parisian weather.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a bimini top and why is it essential?</h2>\n\n<p>A bimini top — sometimes called a <em>sun awning</em> or deck canopy — is a textile shelter installed above the passenger area of a boat. It serves a dual purpose: <strong>providing shade</strong> on sunny days and <strong>sheltering from rain</strong> when Parisian skies turn fickle. On a river cruise boat, it is a feature that fundamentally transforms onboard comfort.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the large, fully glazed sightseeing boats, the Sénang offers an open-air experience, close to the water and the monuments. The bimini top preserves this unique proximity with the Seine while ensuring effective protection from the elements.</p>\n\n<h2>Why did we install this new bimini top?</h2>\n\n<p>Paris is a magnificent city in every season, and the Seine takes on different lights throughout the year. We did not want our cruises to be limited to fine-weather days alone. With this new bimini top, we can now offer <strong>comfortable cruises from spring to autumn</strong>, and even on mild winter days.</p>\n\n<p>Spring showers? You stay dry while admiring the reflections of rain on the Seine. July sunshine? You enjoy welcome shade as Paris glides past your eyes. The soft light of October? The bimini top stays discreet, letting the golden glow of a Parisian autumn pour in.</p>\n\n<h2>An elegant design true to the Sénang's spirit</h2>\n\n<p>The Sénang is an <strong>authentic Dutch tjalk</strong>, a boat of character whose traditional aesthetics are an integral part of the experience. Installing equipment that would detract from its appearance was out of the question. Our new bimini top was custom-made from quality marine fabric whose shade harmonises perfectly with the boat's woodwork and hull.</p>\n\n<p>The structure, both sturdy and lightweight, <strong>does not obstruct the panoramic view in any way</strong>. Whether seated or standing, your gaze sweeps freely across the quays of the Seine, the illuminated bridges and the Parisian monuments. The bimini top fades from notice, leaving nothing but the spectacle of Paris seen from the water.</p>\n\n<h3>Materials built to last</h3>\n\n<p>The selected fabric is a technical marine-grade textile, UV-resistant, waterproof and treated against mould. The brushed stainless-steel hoops resist river corrosion. The entire assembly is removable for the Sénang's winter maintenance, ensuring optimal longevity of the equipment.</p>\n\n<h2>A cruise enhanced in every season</h2>\n\n<p>This new bimini top truly transforms the onboard experience. Picture an <strong>evening aperitif cruise in May</strong>: a few drops of rain begin to fall, but under the bimini top you continue savouring your champagne while the lights of the Bastille reflect in the puddles on the quay. Or imagine a <strong>luncheon on the water in midsummer</strong>: the sun beats down, but in the shade of the bimini top a fresh breeze from the Seine wraps pleasantly around you.</p>\n\n<p>For our event cruises — birthdays, marriage proposals, corporate seminars — the bimini top also adds a cosy, cocoon-like touch that reinforces the private and exclusive character of the experience. Up to <strong>12 passengers</strong> enjoy a sheltered and convivial space, lulled by the gentle lapping of the water.</p>\n\n<h2>A jewel visible from the Port de l'Arsenal</h2>\n\n<p>The Sénang is moored at the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong>, that beautiful marina nestled between the Place de la Bastille and the Seine. The new bimini top adds an elegant silhouette to the boat, which you can spot while strolling along the port. If you are in the neighbourhood, do come and admire the Sénang in its new attire.</p>\n\n<p>You can also discover the bimini top in photos on our Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bateau_a_paris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@bateau_a_paris</a>, where we regularly share pictures of the Sénang and our cruises on the Seine.</p>\n\n<h2>Book your all-season cruise</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to this new bimini top, there is no longer a bad season to step aboard the Sénang. Whether you wish to organise a <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> for a special event or simply enjoy an exceptional moment among friends, we welcome you with the comfort and elegance that are the hallmark of Un Bateau à Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Discover all our <a href=\"/croisiere\">cruise packages</a> starting from €480 and <a href=\"/reservation\">book now</a> your next escape on the Seine.

    "excerpt": "The band Billet Doux took to the deck of the Sénang for an intimate acoustic concert on the Seine. Live music, sunset and illuminated bridges: a look back at an evening that embodies the spirit of Un Bateau à Paris.",
    "content": "<p>Some evenings leave a lasting mark. The night the band <strong>Billet Doux</strong> played an acoustic set on the deck of the Sénang, gliding slowly beneath the illuminated bridges of Paris at sunset, is undoubtedly one of them. This <strong>concert on the Seine</strong> captures the very essence of what we strive to offer at Un Bateau à Paris: unique, intimate and deeply Parisian experiences.</p>\n\n<h2>A magical setting: live music on the Seine at dusk</h2>\n\n<p>Picture the scene. The Sénang gently leaves the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong> as the sun begins its descent behind the rooftops of Paris. The Haussmann façades glow gold and pink. On the deck of the Dutch tjalk, the musicians of Billet Doux tune their instruments. The first chords ring out over the water as the boat glides onto the Seine.</p>\n\n<p>The music blends with the lapping of waves against the hull, with the murmur of the city fading into the distance. Beneath the Pont d'Austerlitz, the notes bounce off century-old stone, creating a striking natural acoustic. It is a suspended moment, <em>one of those instants when Paris reveals itself in all its beauty</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Billet Doux: acoustic intimacy on the water</h2>\n\n<p>The choice of Billet Doux for this evening was no accident. The band performs sensitive acoustic music, woven from delicate melodies and finely crafted lyrics, perfectly suited to the intimate atmosphere of a cruise aboard the Sénang. Their sound, at once warm and airy, converses naturally with the river setting.</p>\n\n<p>On a boat, music takes on a special dimension. Sound travels across the water, the reverberations of bridges add unexpected depth, and the absence of urban noise leaves every note room to breathe. The musicians themselves confided that they had experienced something extraordinary, <strong>playing in a setting that no concert hall could ever replicate</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sénang: a floating concert hall for 12 privileged guests</h2>\n\n<p>What makes these concerts on the Seine truly exceptional is the Sénang's capacity. With a maximum of <strong>12 passengers</strong>, every person on board has a front-row seat. There is no bad spot, no distance between the artists and the audience. You are together, sharing the same breath, carried by the music and the current of the Seine.</p>\n\n<p>This intimacy is the Sénang's signature. Our 12-metre Dutch tjalk is not designed for crowds: it is made for <strong>rare and precious moments</strong>. A private concert on the Seine aboard the Sénang is the very antithesis of a packed sightseeing boat. It is a privilege that only a handful of people in the world can experience.</p>\n\n<h3>The natural acoustics of the Seine</h3>\n\n<p>Professional musicians know it well: water is an extraordinary natural amplifier. Sound propagates with remarkable clarity across the surface of the Seine. Add to that the natural vault formed by the arches of Parisian bridges, and you obtain acoustics that the finest concert halls would envy. Each passage beneath a bridge becomes a sonic event, a musical surprise that the artists learn to use and that passengers remember long afterwards.</p>\n\n<h2>Champagne, music and monuments: an exceptional evening</h2>\n\n<p>While Billet Doux played, passengers savoured a glass of champagne, comfortably settled on deck. The Île Saint-Louis drifted past to starboard, majestic in the light of the setting sun. Then Notre-Dame appeared, its reconstruction scaffolding a testament to Parisian resilience. Camera flashes from tourists on the quays punctuated the gathering night while the music continued, soft and enveloping.</p>\n\n<p>It is this <strong>unique combination</strong> — live music, champagne, the sunset, monuments gliding slowly past — that creates the magic of a musical cruise on the Seine. No restaurant, no rooftop, no bar can offer this experience. It exists only on the water.</p>\n\n<h2>Your cruise, your musical atmosphere</h2>\n\n<p>This concert with Billet Doux perfectly illustrates what we offer at Un Bateau à Paris: <strong>fully bespoke private cruises</strong>. Do you dream of an acoustic concert at sunset? An electro DJ set under the stars? A jazz quartet for a birthday? A violinist for a marriage proposal? Anything is possible aboard the Sénang.</p>\n\n<p>We work with you to create the cruise that reflects who you are. The Sénang becomes your private stage, your floating lounge, your bubble of excellence on the Seine. Music is just one example of the countless possibilities offered by a private charter of the Sénang.</p>\n\n<h3>More than a cruise: a bespoke experience</h3>\n\n<p>This is what sets Un Bateau à Paris apart from other Seine cruise offerings. We do not offer a standardised product. We create with you a <strong>unique moment</strong>, thoughtfully designed down to the smallest detail, crafted in your image. Whether for a corporate event, a family celebration or an evening among friends, the Sénang is the setting for your finest Parisian memories.</p>\n\n<h2>Set sail for your own concert on the Seine</h2>\n\n<p>Tempted by a <strong>private musical cruise on the Seine</strong>? Contact us to imagine together your ideal evening. Our private cruises are available from €480 and welcome up to 12 passengers for a truly intimate experience.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your private cruise</a> and let yourself be carried by the music, the current and the magic of Paris seen from the water.

    "slug": "renovation-hivernale-2025-2026-senang",
    "excerpt": "Every winter, the Sénang enters the boatyard for a full refit. Hull painting, varnish, safety equipment and navigation instruments: discover the behind-the-scenes of our Dutch tjalk's winter maintenance.",
    "content": "<p>While Paris wraps itself in its winter coat, the Sénang lives its own season: that of the <strong>winter refit</strong>. Every year, our 12-metre Dutch tjalk receives a complete overhaul — an age-old maritime tradition that guarantees our passengers safety, comfort and beauty on every cruise. Here is a behind-the-scenes look at the <strong>2025–2026 refit of the Sénang</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>A maritime tradition: the boat's winter maintenance</h2>\n\n<p>In the world of sailing, winter is the season of care. It is a tradition as old as seafaring itself: when waters cool and pleasure boating pauses, boats enter the yard to be inspected, repaired and beautified. For the Sénang, this period is sacred. It is the guarantee of quality and reliability that we owe our passengers.</p>\n\n<p>The winter refit is not a simple clean-up. It is a <strong>complete restoration</strong>, methodical and exacting, covering every aspect of the boat: hull, deck, woodwork, hardware, safety equipment and navigation instruments. Nothing is left to chance.</p>\n\n<h2>Hull painting: protection and beauty</h2>\n\n<p>The first major project this winter concerns the <strong>hull painting</strong>. The Sénang was lifted out of the water to allow full access to her steel hull. The process begins with meticulous stripping of the old paint layers, followed by rigorous anti-corrosion treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Next comes the application of <strong>antifouling</strong>, the special paint that prevents marine organisms from attaching to the hull. This is a crucial element for sailing performance and preservation of the boat's structure. Finally, the finishing coats restore the Sénang's traditional colours, true to the heritage of Dutch tjalks.</p>\n\n<h3>Artisan craftsmanship</h3>\n\n<p>Hull painting is a craft in its own right. The artisans working on the Sénang master the traditional techniques of marine painting. Each coat is applied under precise conditions of temperature and humidity, with drying times scrupulously observed. The result is a hull that is both <strong>perfectly protected and beautifully finished</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Varnish restoration: bringing the woodwork back to life</h2>\n\n<p>The Sénang owes much of its charm to its <strong>teak and fine-wood joinery</strong>. The bulwarks, coamings, coach roof and deck fittings — wood is everywhere and contributes to the warm, authentic atmosphere of the boat. But wood on water is put to a harsh test. UV rays, humidity, temperature swings and spray constantly attack the varnish.</p>\n\n<p>Varnish restoration is a work of patience and precision. The old coats are sanded by hand, grit by grit, until the bare wood is revealed. Then come the new coats of marine varnish, a product specially formulated to withstand river conditions. <strong>Five to seven coats</strong> are needed to achieve optimal shine and protection.</p>\n\n<p>The result is spectacular: the woodwork regains its golden lustre, its grain stands out with clarity, and the Sénang gleams as on its very first day. It is a feast for the eyes that our passengers appreciate the moment they step aboard.</p>\n\n<h2>Safety equipment: the absolute priority</h2>\n\n<p>The beauty of the Sénang would be nothing without the <strong>safety of its passengers</strong>. Winter is the opportunity for a full overhaul of all safety equipment on board. Every item is inspected, tested and replaced if necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Life jackets</strong> are checked one by one: fabric condition, inflation system operation, integrity of straps and buckles. <strong>Fire extinguishers</strong> are inspected and recharged to current standards. The <strong>first-aid kit</strong> is restocked with fresh supplies. <strong>Navigation lights</strong> — the regulatory lights that signal a vessel's position and heading at night — are tested and replaced if needed.</p>\n\n<p>We go beyond regulatory requirements. Safety aboard the Sénang is not an administrative formality: it is a <em>deep conviction</em>. Our passengers must be able to enjoy their cruise with complete peace of mind, and that begins with a boat that is irreproachable in terms of safety.</p>\n\n<h2>Navigation instruments: technology in the service of tradition</h2>\n\n<p>While the Sénang is a traditional boat in soul and aesthetics, it carries <strong>modern navigation technology</strong> in the service of safety and comfort. This winter, we are updating and inspecting all instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>GPS</strong> is checked and updated with the latest river charts. The <strong>VHF radio</strong>, essential for communication with locks, other vessels and port authorities, is tested on all frequencies. The <strong>depth sounder</strong> is recalibrated to ensure precise readings of the Seine's riverbed. These instruments, invisible to passengers, are essential to the smooth running of every cruise.</p>\n\n<h2>Maritime craftsmanship: expert hands in the service of the Sénang</h2>\n\n<p>The Sénang's winter refit calls upon <strong>artisans specialising in river craft</strong>. Painters, varnishers, mechanics, marine electricians — each brings their expertise and their love of a job well done. These trades, sometimes little known, perpetuate precious know-how. Working on a Dutch tjalk like the Sénang means touching the history of European navigation, and our artisans are fully aware of it.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sénang will return in spring 2026 more beautiful than ever</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of this winter refit, the Sénang will return to her berth at the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong> in Paris's 12th arrondissement, ready for a new season of private cruises on the Seine. Immaculate hull, gleaming woodwork, brand-new equipment: our Dutch tjalk will be more beautiful and safer than ever to welcome you aboard.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot wait to see you on board. In the meantime, you can already browse our <a href=\"/croisiere\">cruise packages</a> and plan your next escape on the Seine. Our private cruises, starting from €480 for up to 12 passengers, await you as soon as the fine weather returns.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your cruise for spring 2026</a> and be among the first to rediscover the Sénang in all its restored splendour. Also explore our <a href=\"/galerie\">photo gallery</a> for a glimpse of what awaits you on board.</p>",
