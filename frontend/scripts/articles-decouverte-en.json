    "content": "<p>Paris can be discovered in a thousand ways, but none rivals the magic of a private cruise on the Seine. Picture this: you step aboard an authentic 12-metre Dutch tjalk, the <strong>Sénang</strong>, moored at the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong> in Paris's 12<sup>th</sup> arrondissement. The mooring lines are cast off, and the City of Light unfolds before your eyes, monument after monument, bridge after bridge. This privilege, once reserved for a select few, is now within reach for all your special occasions. Here are the five life moments that deserve a celebration on the water.</p>\n\n<h2>1. An unforgettable hen party on the Seine</h2>\n\n<p>A hen party is much more than a girls' night out: it is the last great moment of freedom before the wedding, the one that will still be talked about twenty years from now. And what better backdrop than the Seine to celebrate it? Aboard the Sénang, the hen party takes on a unique dimension. No queues, no nosy neighbours at the next table: <strong>the boat is entirely privatised</strong> for your group, up to 12 guests.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the bride-to-be discovering the surprise on the quay at the Port de l'Arsenal. Laughter erupts the moment everyone boards, the champagne flows, and music accompanies your passage beneath the bridges of Paris. You glide past the Île Saint-Louis, Notre-Dame, the Louvre… The setting is spectacular, the photos will be sublime, and the atmosphere remains <em>intimate</em> — exactly what is needed for a cherished moment among friends.</p>\n\n<p>Decorations, a personalised playlist, catering: everything can be arranged to your wishes. A hen party on the Seine is the guarantee of a memory etched forever. <a href=\"/evjf-seine\">Discover our hen party on the Seine package</a> and start planning the celebration.</p>\n\n<h2>2. A romantic cruise for two</h2>\n\n<p>Paris is the world capital of love, and the Seine is its main artery. A <strong>private romantic cruise</strong> on the Sénang means offering your other half a moment out of time, far from the bustle of packed restaurants and noisy terraces. Here, the tête-à-tête is absolute.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it is for a marriage proposal — imagine getting down on one knee as the Eiffel Tower sparkles on the horizon —, a dating anniversary or simply a declaration of love, the setting speaks for itself. The deck of the Sénang becomes your private lounge, with a panoramic view of the capital's most beautiful monuments. The sun descends gently, the Haussmann façades turn gold, and time stands still.</p>\n\n<p>Add a bottle of champagne, a few candles, a soft playlist, and you have the most romantic evening of your life. No need for fancy words: the Seine does the rest. <a href=\"/croisiere-romantique-seine\">Explore our romantic cruise on the Seine</a> to prepare your surprise.</p>\n\n<h2>3. A birthday celebrated on the water</h2>\n\n<p>Blowing out your candles on a boat, with Paris as a backdrop: now that is a birthday idea that truly stands out. The Sénang welcomes up to <strong>12 guests</strong>, making it the perfect setting for an intimate and warm celebration. No hundreds of unknown guests, no impersonal function room: just your loved ones, gathered on the deck of a magnificent Dutch tjalk.</p>\n\n<p>Milestone birthdays — 30, 40, 50 — deserve a setting worthy of the occasion. But a birthday on the Seine does not need a round number to be memorable. Every year counts, and every voyage is different: the light changes, the seasons turn, and Paris constantly reinvents itself when seen from the water.</p>\n\n<p>Cake, buffet, entertainment: you compose the celebration as you see fit. The captain takes care of the navigation; you take care of enjoying yourself. It is as simple as that. <a href=\"/anniversaire-seine\">Organise your birthday on the Seine</a> right now.</p>\n\n<h2>4. An original team building away from the office</h2>\n\n<p>Meeting-room seminars, escape games you have already done three times, company bowling: let us be honest, team building often lacks inspiration. A <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> changes the game entirely. The moment your colleagues step onto the deck of the Sénang, office codes fade away. Hierarchies relax, conversations become natural, and team cohesion builds on its own.</p>\n\n<p>The format is ideal for small teams: up to 12 people, precisely the right size for a management committee, a project team or a group of managers. The atmosphere is at once <em>professional and relaxed</em>, conducive to genuine exchanges. You brainstorm better with the spire of Notre-Dame in the background — it has been proven.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome cocktail, informal presentation, creative workshop on deck: the possibilities are many. And when your colleagues recount their day at home, they will not say \u201cwe did a team building\u201d but \u201cwe sailed the Seine.\u201d The difference is considerable. <a href=\"/team-building-seine\">Discover our team building on the Seine package</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. A sunset cruise</h2>\n\n<p>There is a precise moment, every day, when Paris transforms. Parisians call it the <em>golden hour</em>: that fleeting window when the sun dips behind the rooftops, flooding the city with a warm, coppery light. From the Seine, this spectacle is simply <strong>breathtaking</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A sunset cruise aboard the Sénang is a complete sensory experience. The sky shifts from blue to pink, then to orange and violet. Reflections dance on the water, monuments light up one by one, and the Eiffel Tower begins to sparkle. You have the best seat in the house for the most beautiful show in Paris, a glass in hand, a gentle breeze in your hair.</p>\n\n<p>This cruise suits every occasion — or no particular one at all. Sometimes the finest gift you can give yourself is simply taking the time to contemplate. A sunset on the Seine cannot be told: it must be lived. <a href=\"/coucher-soleil-seine\">Book your sunset cruise</a> and let Paris do the rest.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sénang: your setting for every occasion</h2>\n\n<p>Whatever the occasion, the <strong>Sénang</strong> is far more than a boat: it is a living space, a place of emotion, a backdrop that no restaurant or reception hall can match. This authentic Dutch tjalk, with its spacious deck and warm interior, transforms every event into an imperishable memory.</p>\n\n<p>With <strong>private cruises starting from €480</strong> for the entire boat, the dream is more accessible than you might think. Shared among friends, colleagues or as a couple, the price per person remains remarkably gentle for an experience that is absolutely unique in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>So, what will your next occasion be? <strong><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your private cruise on the Seine</a></strong> and treat yourself to Paris seen from the water.</p>",

    "excerpt": "Champagne, sunset and Parisian monuments: the boat aperitif on the Seine elevates French art de vivre to new heights. A complete guide to an unforgettable aperitif aboard the Sénang, departing from the Port de l'Arsenal.",
    "content": "<p>There is a French tradition that the whole world envies: the <strong>apéro</strong>. That sacred moment, tucked between the end of the day and dinner, when you take the time to gather around a glass and a few bites. In Paris, the apéro is enjoyed on terraces, along the quays, in hidden courtyards. But there is a superior version, an art form in its own right: the <em>boat aperitif on the Seine</em>. Aboard the Sénang, an authentic Dutch tjalk moored at the Port de l'Arsenal, the Parisian aperitif reaches its most accomplished expression.</p>\n\n<h2>The boat aperitif: much more than a simple drink</h2>\n\n<p>Forget the usual bar counter and the terrace where you fight for a seat. The boat aperitif is an <strong>immersive experience</strong> that engages all the senses. The lapping of water against the hull, the light breeze brushing your skin, the scent of the Seine mingling with the bubbles of champagne sparkling in your glass. It is watching Paris drift slowly by, monument after monument, bridge after bridge, like a film in which you are the lead character.</p>\n\n<p>On the Sénang, the aperitif takes on a private and exclusive dimension. No tourists with selfie sticks, no loudspeakers broadcasting commentary in eight languages. Just you, your loved ones — <strong>up to 12 guests</strong> — and the most beautiful avenue in the world unfolding before your eyes. The welcome champagne is served, toasts are raised, and the evening may begin.</p>\n\n<h2>The golden hour: the perfect moment to embark</h2>\n\n<p>It is all a matter of <em>timing</em>. The finest boat aperitif is experienced at the <strong>golden hour</strong>, that magical moment when the sun begins its descent and bathes Paris in a warm, almost unreal light. The cut-stone façades of Haussmann buildings take on hues of honey, the Seine becomes a golden mirror, and the silhouettes of bridges stand out against a picture-postcard sky.</p>\n\n<p>In summer, the golden hour stretches out languidly: the ideal boarding time is between 7 pm and 8 pm, to enjoy the fading light and then the city's gradual illumination. In autumn and spring, the sun sets earlier, offering cruises that begin in daylight and end amid the enchantment of illuminated monuments. It is precisely this <strong>transition between day and night</strong> that makes the boat aperitif so spectacular.</p>\n\n<h2>Aboard the Sénang: a unique art of hospitality</h2>\n\n<p>The Sénang is no ordinary boat. This <strong>12-metre Dutch tjalk</strong> possesses a soul, a history, a character. Its spacious deck offers an unobstructed 360-degree view of the Seine and its banks. Comfortable bench seats invite you to settle in for the duration of the cruise. Should it turn cool, the bimini top — that protective canopy — deploys to create a warm cocoon without sacrificing the view.</p>\n\n<p>From the moment you board, the mood is set: a glass of champagne or a welcome cocktail, carefully prepared canapés, and, if you wish, a musical playlist to accompany the voyage. Everything is designed so that you have <em>absolutely nothing to do</em> but savour the moment. The captain takes the helm; you take charge of living the instant.</p>\n\n<h2>The itinerary: a parade of monuments</h2>\n\n<p>Departure is from the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong>, nestled between the Bastille and the Seine in Paris's 12<sup>th</sup> arrondissement. This discreet and charming embarkation point is in itself a discovery for many Parisians. Then the cruise begins, and the spectacle unfolds.</p>\n\n<p>The Île Saint-Louis appears first, with its quays lined with 17<sup>th</sup>-century private mansions. Then <strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong> rises up, majestic, its restoration works a testament to the capital's resilience. The Sénang glides beneath the Pont Neuf — the oldest bridge in Paris, despite its name — before passing along the <strong>Louvre</strong> and the Tuileries Garden.</p>\n\n<p>On the Left Bank, the <strong>Musée d'Orsay</strong> reveals its former railway-station façade. Further on, the <strong>Invalides</strong> and their gilded dome catch the last rays of the sun. And finally, as a crowning moment, the <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> reveals itself in all its splendour. When it begins to sparkle, exclamations ring out on board. It is a moment of pure emotion, even for those who have seen it a thousand times.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it is incomparable with a bar or restaurant</h2>\n\n<p>You could take your aperitif at a Parisian rooftop with a view over the rooftops. You could book a terrace table beside the Seine. But nothing replaces <strong>movement</strong>. On a boat, the scenery changes constantly. Every second offers a new frame, a new angle, a new perspective on the city.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the <strong>intimacy</strong>. In a bar, you share the space with dozens of strangers. On the Sénang, you are at home. You speak freely, laugh loudly, dance if the mood takes you. The boat is your <em>private bubble</em> in the heart of the most beautiful city in the world. This sensation of freedom, of floating — in every sense of the word — is unique and addictive.</p>\n\n<h2>Practical tips for your boat aperitif</h2>\n\n<h3>What to wear?</h3>\n<p>Opt for a chic yet comfortable outfit. Flat shoes are recommended on the boat deck. In the evening, even in summer, bring a light jacket or shawl: the breeze on the Seine is pleasantly refreshing but can catch you off guard.</p>\n\n<h3>Which season to choose?</h3>\n<p>Spring and summer offer the longest and mildest evenings, with spectacular sunsets. Autumn brings extraordinary low-angle light and tawny hues along the quays. In winter, with the bimini top deployed and a warm drink in hand, the boat aperitif takes on the feel of a <strong>cosy cocoon cruise</strong>, with Christmas illuminations as a bonus.</p>\n\n<h3>What to bring?</h3>\n<p>Your good spirits, essentially. Everything else — champagne, glassware, setup — is taken care of. You may of course bring a cake for a birthday or special decorations. Do not forget your camera: the opportunities for exceptional shots are countless.</p>\n\n<h2>For whom? For every desire</h2>\n\n<p>A boat aperitif on the Seine needs no excuse. It is perfect for a <strong>group of friends</strong> who want to mark an occasion, for a <strong>couple</strong> seeking a moment apart, for a <strong>small celebration</strong> — a promotion, a reunion, a farewell — or simply for the pleasure of living an exceptional Parisian moment.</p>\n\n<p>It is also an extraordinary gift idea. To offer a boat aperitif on the Seine is to offer a memory, an emotion, an enchanted interlude. Few gifts can rival it. <a href=\"/apero-bateau-seine\">Discover our boat aperitif package</a> or combine it with a <a href=\"/coucher-soleil-seine\">sunset on the Seine</a> for an even more memorable experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Art de vivre, Seine-side</h2>\n\n<p>A boat aperitif on the Seine is the quintessence of <strong>Parisian art de vivre</strong>. It is taking the time, savouring the moment, contemplating the beauty around you. It is transforming a simple drink among friends into an exceptional occasion. Aboard the Sénang, with Paris drifting past and the sun descending, every sip tastes different, every laugh rings louder, every second matters more.</p>\n\n<p>Private cruises are available <strong>from €480</strong> for the entire boat. Shared among friends, this represents a remarkably gentle cost per person for an experience you will never forget.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/reservation\">Book your boat aperitif on the Seine</a></strong> and discover why those who have experienced it never want to take their aperitif any other way.</p>",
