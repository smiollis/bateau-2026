    "content": "<p><strong>Navigation on the Seine</strong> is inseparable from the history of Paris. For over a millennium, the river has carried kings, merchants, artists, and travelers. Even today, sailing its waters remains one of the most enchanting ways to discover the capital. Here is a look back at a <strong>fascinating history</strong>, from royal barges to <strong>private cruises on the Seine</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Medieval origins: merchants and the Parisian nautes</h2>\n\n<p>The history of <strong>navigation on the Seine</strong> dates back to antiquity. The Parisii, the Gallic tribe that gave Paris its name, were already skilled boatmen. After the Roman conquest, Lutetia prospered thanks to river trade. The corporation of <strong>Parisian nautes</strong> (boatmen), documented as early as the 1st century by the famous Pillar of the Nautes discovered beneath Notre-Dame, bears witness to this ancestral activity.</p>\n<p>During the Middle Ages, the Seine became the economic lifeline of Paris. <strong>Cargo boats</strong> transported wood, wine, wheat, and building stone. The powerful guild of water merchants, forerunner of the Parisian municipality, controlled river traffic. Their motto, <em>Fluctuat nec mergitur</em> (\"She is tossed by the waves but does not sink\"), would become the motto of the city of Paris itself. Ports multiplied along the banks: the grain port, the wine port, the hay port. Each quay had its specialty, and the river teemed with activity from dawn to dusk.</p>\n\n<h2>Royal boats and festivities on the water</h2>\n\n<p>From the Renaissance onward, the Seine welcomed a new kind of navigation: <strong>royal vessels</strong>. Francis I, Henry IV, and Louis XIV used sumptuously decorated barges for their travels and receptions. <strong>Nautical festivals</strong> became a prized spectacle at court. In 1518, Francis I organized a grand naval joust in front of the Louvre to impress foreign ambassadors.</p>\n<p>Under Louis XIV, <strong>royal gondolas</strong> cruised the Seine during lavish ceremonies. The Sun King even brought Venetian gondoliers to enliven his festivities. These vessels, adorned with gilding and sculptures, foreshadowed the art of <strong>luxury cruising</strong> on the Parisian river. The tradition of waterborne receptions was born — a tradition that endures today in a more intimate form through <strong>private cruises</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>The 19th century: the golden age of river transport</h2>\n\n<p>The Industrial Revolution radically transformed <strong>navigation on the Seine</strong>. In 1816, the first steamboat, the Charles-Philippe, traveled up the river between Paris and Montereau. It was a revolution. <strong>Steamboats</strong> gradually replaced sailing vessels and rowboats, making navigation faster and more regular.</p>\n<p>In 1867, during the Paris World's Fair, Jean-Sébastien Mouche launched his famous <strong>bateaux-mouches</strong> (sightseeing boats) on the Seine. Built in the Mouche district of Lyon, these boats offered <strong>tourist excursions</strong> to the general public for the first time. The success was immediate: thousands of Parisians and visitors discovered the city from the water. The bateaux-mouches would become an institution, though the concept of tourist cruising on the Seine is even older, rooted in centuries of river tradition.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <strong>floating laundries</strong>, floating baths, and riverside guinguettes (open-air dance halls) made the Seine a lively gathering place. The river was not merely a transport route: it was the beating heart of Parisian life.</p>\n\n<h2>The 20th century: decline and rebirth of the Seine</h2>\n\n<p>The rise of railways and automobiles in the 20th century gradually marginalized <strong>river transport</strong>. Commercial traffic declined, and the expressways built along the riverbanks in 1967 distanced Parisians from their river. The Seine seemed destined to become nothing more than a backdrop.</p>\n<p>Yet <strong>pleasure boating</strong> took over. Péniches (traditional barges) were converted into homes, tourist cruises modernized, and a new kind of navigation emerged: the <strong>private cruise</strong>. Far from the crowded tourist boats, human-scale vessels offered an intimate, personalized experience on the river.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the left bank promenades were returned to pedestrians. In 2024, the Seine hosted the <strong>opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games</strong>, consecrating the river as a world stage. Navigation on the Seine has never been more alive.</p>\n\n<h2>Today: the private cruise, heir to a long tradition</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Private cruises on the Seine</strong> are a direct continuation of this thousand-year history. Like the royal barges of old, they offer an exclusive experience, far from the crowds, close to the water and the monuments. Boarding a private boat means reconnecting with a tradition of <strong>intimate, elegant navigation</strong> that spans the centuries.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Un Bateau à Paris</strong>, this tradition comes to life aboard the Sénang, a traditional Dutch barge moored at the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong>, in the heart of the 12th arrondissement. Accommodating up to 12 passengers, the Sénang carries on the centuries-old art of cruising the Seine in an authentic, warm setting. Whether you wish to celebrate an event or simply admire Paris from the river, <a href=\"/reservation\">book a private cruise</a> and write your own chapter in the great history of <strong>navigation on the Seine</strong>.</p>",

    "excerpt": "From Lutetia to the 2024 Olympic Games, the Seine has shaped Paris for 2,000 years. Dive into the history of France's most famous river, witness to every era.",
    "content": "<p>The <strong>Seine</strong> is not merely a river that crosses Paris: it is Paris. For two millennia, this 776-kilometer waterway has shaped the geography, economy, architecture, and very soul of the French capital. From <strong>Lutetia</strong> to the modern metropolis, every era has left its mark on its banks. To trace the <strong>history of the Seine</strong> is to journey through the entire history of France.</p>\n\n<h2>Lutetia: Paris is born on the Seine</h2>\n\n<p>The story begins on the <strong>Île de la Cité</strong>, the cradle of Paris. Around the 3rd century BCE, the Gallic tribe known as the Parisii settled on this island, naturally protected by the arms of the river. The location was strategic: the <strong>Seine</strong> allowed them to control trade between northern and southern Gaul.</p>\n<p>After the Roman conquest in 52 BCE, Lutetia developed on the Left Bank. The Romans built baths, a forum, and an amphitheater, but the river remained the driving force of the city. The <strong>Pillar of the Nautes</strong>, a votive monument erected by the boatmen's guild in the 1st century, proves that the Seine was already at the center of economic and religious life. Discovered in 1711 beneath the choir of Notre-Dame, it is the oldest known monument in Paris.</p>\n\n<h2>The Middle Ages: the Seine feeds and protects Paris</h2>\n\n<p>During the Middle Ages, the <strong>Seine became the vital artery</strong> of a rapidly expanding city. The river supplied Paris with food, building materials, and fuel. Watermills multiplied beneath the bridges, while the water merchants gained considerable power. The <em>Hanse des marchands de l'eau</em> (Guild of Water Merchants), founded in the 12th century, controlled all river traffic and laid the foundations of the Parisian municipality.</p>\n<p>This was also the era of grand construction along the riverbanks. The building of <strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong> began in 1163, with stones arriving by river from the quarries of the Oise. The Louvre, initially a medieval fortress, was built along the Right Bank. The <strong>Sainte-Chapelle</strong>, a jewel of Rayonnant Gothic architecture, rose on the Île de la Cité in 1248. All these monuments, still admired today from the Seine, testify to the river's central role in Parisian urban planning.</p>\n<p>The <strong>bridges of Paris</strong> also tell this story. The Pont-Neuf, despite its name (\"New Bridge\"), is the oldest standing bridge in Paris, inaugurated by Henry IV in 1607. The first bridge without houses, it offered an unobstructed view of the river for the first time, transforming the relationship between Parisians and their Seine.</p>\n\n<h2>The Great Works: Haussmann and the quays of the Seine</h2>\n\n<p>Under the Second Empire, Baron <strong>Haussmann</strong> radically transformed the face of Paris, and the Seine was no exception. Between 1853 and 1870, the banks were reinforced, the quays were lined with masonry and widened, and access routes to the river were redesigned. The <strong>quays of the Seine</strong> became true tree-lined promenades.</p>\n<p>Haussmann also ordered the construction of large sewer collectors that diverted wastewater away from the Seine, greatly improving the river's sanitation. The bouquinistes (second-hand booksellers), already present since the 16th century, established themselves permanently on the quay parapets, creating the <strong>open-air bookshop</strong> that still defines the charm of the riverbanks today. In 1991, the <strong>banks of the Seine in Paris</strong> were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the ultimate recognition of the unique harmony between a river and its city.</p>\n\n<h2>1910: the great flood, Paris underwater</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>history of the Seine</strong> is not only a story of glory. In January 1910, Paris endured one of its worst natural disasters. After weeks of rain, the river reached 8.62 meters at the Pont d'Austerlitz, compared to the normal 2 meters. The <strong>flood of 1910</strong> submerged entire neighborhoods: the Marais, the Gare Saint-Lazare, and part of the 7th arrondissement were underwater.</p>\n<p>The Zouave statue on the Pont de l'Alma, a military figure installed in 1856, then became the popular benchmark for the Seine's water level. When \"the Zouave's feet are in the water,\" Parisians start worrying. In 1910, the water reached his shoulders. The city took months to recover from this historic flood, and the threat of another great flood is still taken very seriously by authorities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Seine today: living heritage and a place of wonder</h2>\n\n<p>In the 21st century, the <strong>Seine</strong> is experiencing a genuine renaissance. The pedestrian riverbanks, inaugurated on the Left Bank in 2013, have given the river back to Parisians and strollers. <strong>Péniches</strong> (traditional barges) have been transformed into living spaces, restaurants, and cultural venues. In 2024, the Seine took center stage during the <strong>opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games</strong>, a historic nautical parade that consecrated the river as the capital's most beautiful avenue.</p>\n<p>Swimming in the Seine, banned since 1923, has become a concrete goal once again, a sign that the river is regaining an environmental quality lost for a century. Paris is reconnecting with its waterway, and the <strong>Seine is once again a place of life</strong>, celebration, and discovery.</p>\n<p>To take in these <strong>2,000 years of history</strong> in a single glance, nothing rivals a cruise on the river. From the deck of a boat, every bridge, every monument, every quay tells a chapter of the great Parisian adventure. With <strong>Un Bateau à Paris</strong>, board the Sénang departing from the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong> for a private cruise that transforms the river into an open-air history book. <a href=\"/croisiere\">Discover our cruise packages</a> and live this unique experience with friends or family, on the water and through the ages.</p>",

    "excerpt": "Houseboats, floating restaurants, private cruises: the Seine is the birthplace of a unique art of living. Discover the culture of waterside life in Paris and the story of the Sénang.",
    "content": "<p>In Paris, the <strong>Seine</strong> is not just a river: it is a neighborhood in its own right. For decades, hundreds of <strong>péniches</strong> (traditional barges) have lined its quays, housing residences, restaurants, concert halls, and artists' studios. This <strong>art of living on the water</strong> is an under-appreciated yet deeply rooted Parisian tradition. At the heart of this floating culture, the <strong>Sénang</strong> carries on the spirit of the great Dutch barges while offering a unique <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Parisian barges: a century-old floating culture</h2>\n\n<p>The history of <strong>Parisian péniches</strong> begins in the early 20th century, when the first bargemen's families settled permanently on their boats, converting old cargo barges into year-round homes. After World War II, the decline of river freight freed up many vessels that found a second life as floating residences.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, <strong>péniches</strong> attracted a bohemian, artistic crowd. Painters, musicians, and writers moved into these unconventional spaces, drawn by the ever-changing light on the river and the freedom of waterside life. The <strong>Quai de la Tournelle</strong>, the <strong>Quai de Jemmapes</strong> along the Canal Saint-Martin, and the <strong>Bassin de l'Arsenal</strong> became creative enclaves where art, conviviality, and a unique relationship with the city intertwined.</p>\n<p>Today, there are approximately <strong>1,000 houseboats</strong> in Paris and its near suburbs. Life on the water remains as appealing as ever, despite the challenges: humidity, regular hull maintenance, and sometimes precarious moorings. For those who live on them, the daily spectacle of reflections on the water and the gentle rocking of the boat are more than worth the trade-offs.</p>\n\n<h2>Floating restaurants and party venues: the Seine as a stage</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Parisian péniches</strong> are not just homes. Since the 1990s, a thriving cultural and gastronomic economy has developed on the river. Barge-restaurants like the <strong>Pavillon Puebla</strong> and legendary venues like the <strong>Batofar</strong>, a former Irish lightship converted into a nightclub, have turned the riverbanks into hubs for nightlife and fine dining.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating restaurants</strong> have multiplied, offering a unique culinary experience with views of Parisian landmarks. Dining on a barge moored opposite Notre-Dame or sipping a cocktail while watching the sunset behind the Eiffel Tower: this is the promise behind the success of <strong>gastronomic life on the Seine</strong>. Péniches also host private events — weddings, corporate seminars, and birthday celebrations — continuing the centuries-old tradition of festivities on the water.</p>\n<p>This vibrant scene has given rise to a true <strong>Parisian art de vivre</strong>, where the river is no longer merely a backdrop but a central player in the experience. Enjoying an apéritif at the water's edge, feeling the river breeze, hearing the water lap against the hull — these are the sensations that define a distinctly Parisian way of enjoying life.</p>\n\n<h2>The Sénang: a Dutch barge in the heart of Paris</h2>\n\n<p>Within this floating world, the <strong>Sénang</strong> holds a special place. This <strong>Dutch tjalk</strong>, a type of traditional flat-bottomed sailing vessel from the Netherlands, was built to navigate the canals and estuaries of Northern Europe. Tjalks were used from the 17th century onward to transport goods across the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, recognizable by their rounded hulls and their <em>leeboards</em>, the distinctive lateral keels.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Sénang</strong> has been fully renovated to begin a second life as a <strong>private cruise boat on the Seine</strong>. While preserving its authentic character as a traditional Dutch barge, it has been fitted out to welcome up to <strong>12 passengers</strong> in a warm, elegant setting. Its open deck offers a 360-degree view of Parisian landmarks, while its wooden interior preserves the cozy atmosphere of boats from a bygone era.</p>\n<p>Moored at the <strong>Port de l'Arsenal</strong>, in Paris's 12th arrondissement, the Sénang enjoys an ideal location. This marina, situated between the Place de la Bastille and the Seine, is itself steeped in history: a former basin dug under Charles X in the 1820s, it once connected the Canal Saint-Martin to the Seine before being converted into a marina in 1983.</p>\n\n<h2>The art of living on the Seine: apéritifs, sunsets, and private moments</h2>\n\n<p>What sets a <strong>private cruise on the Seine</strong> apart from any other Parisian experience is the intimate connection with the river and the city. Far from the large tourist boats and their hundreds of passengers, a private cruise recreates the atmosphere of a gathering among friends or family, at the peaceful rhythm of the water.</p>\n<p>Picture a <strong>sunset apéritif</strong>, a glass of champagne in hand, as the Sénang glides silently past the Île Saint-Louis bathed in golden light. Or an <strong>intimate birthday celebration</strong>, with the sparkling Eiffel Tower as the backdrop. This is the <strong>art of living</strong> that makes private navigation magical: time stands still, the city reveals itself in a new light, and every moment becomes a memory.</p>\n<p>This experience is part of a deeply Parisian tradition. From the bals musettes (accordion dance halls) along the banks of the Marne to the guinguettes (open-air riverside cafés) of Nogent, from royal nautical festivals to jazzy evenings on the péniches of Quai de la Gare, the French have always celebrated the <strong>art of living by the water</strong>. The private cruise is the most refined and intimate expression of this tradition.</p>\n\n<h2>Live the experience: board the Sénang</h2>\n\n<p>With <strong>Un Bateau à Paris</strong>, this <strong>art of living on the Seine</strong> is accessible to everyone. The Sénang offers <strong>private cruises</strong> lasting two hours, departing from the Port de l'Arsenal, five times a day. Whether for a <strong>romantic cruise</strong> for two, a family gathering, a corporate event, or a celebration among friends, the boat adapts to every occasion.</p>\n<p>Every cruise includes a glass of champagne or a welcome cocktail, and the route takes you past the most beautiful monuments of Paris as seen from the river: Notre-Dame, the Louvre, the Musée d'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides. On board, you are at home, with the Seine as your garden and Paris as your backdrop. <a href=\"/reservation\">Book your private cruise</a> and experience this unique art of living, inherited from centuries of Parisian river tradition.</p>",
